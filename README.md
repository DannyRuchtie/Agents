# Personal AI Assistant

Your friendly AI assistant that acts like a close friend who knows you well and is always ready to help. It remembers your conversations, family details, and preferences, making every interaction personal and natural. Think of it as having a knowledgeable friend who's always there to chat, help with tasks, or find information - all while keeping the conversation casual and fun.

## What Makes This Special?

- **Acts Like a Real Friend**: Not just an AI - it's a friendly presence that knows you, your family, and your preferences
- **Natural Conversations**: Chats like a real person, with appropriate humor and personality
- **Remembers Everything**: Uses past conversations to make interactions more personal
- **Always Helpful**: Combines being friendly with being genuinely useful
- **Voice Enabled**: Can speak responses naturally, making it feel more like talking to a friend

## How It Behaves

The assistant is designed to be your friendly helper who:
- Greets you warmly and remembers previous conversations
- Uses casual, natural language instead of formal responses
- Brings up relevant details about you and your family when appropriate
- Keeps things light and fun while still being helpful
- Adapts its personality to match your preferences

### Personality Traits

The assistant's personality is customizable but always maintains a friendly, helpful demeanor:

- **Humor**: Can be witty and fun (adjustable from subtle to more playful)
- **Formality**: Keeps things casual like a friend (adjustable to your comfort level)
- **Empathy**: Shows understanding and support when needed
- **Engagement**: Shows genuine interest in your questions and concerns
- **Enthusiasm**: Maintains an upbeat, positive attitude

### Example Conversations

```
You: Hi there!
Assistant: Hey! Great to see you! How can I help you today? ðŸ˜Š

You: Can you remind me what my kids' names are?
Assistant: Of course! You have two wonderful children - Lena and Tobias! How are they doing?

You: I need help planning a trip
Assistant: I'd love to help you plan something! Given that you have two kids, Lena and Tobias, 
should we look for family-friendly destinations? I remember we talked about Bali before - 
is that still interesting, or would you like to explore other options? ðŸ˜Š

You: What's new in tech?
Assistant: Let me check that for you! I know you're interested in AI and development, 
so I'll focus on those areas while keeping it practical and relevant to your work.

## Chat Integration Guide

### Implementing Chat in External Applications

Here's how to implement a chat interface using the API:

```python
import requests
import json

class AgentChatClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url="http://localhost:8000"):
        self.base_url = base_url
        
    def check_connection(self):
        response = requests.get(f"{self.base_url}/")
        return response.status_code == 200
    
    def send_message(self, message):
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.base_url}/query",
            json={"query": message},
            headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
        )
        return response.json()
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the chat client
chat = AgentChatClient()

# Check if API is available
if chat.check_connection():
    # Start a conversation
    response = chat.send_message("Hello! How are you?")
    print(response['response'])
    
    # Continue the conversation (context is maintained by the API)
    response = chat.send_message("What was my previous message?")
    print(response['response'])
```

### Swift Implementation

For iOS/macOS applications:

```swift
class AgentChat {
    private let baseURL = "http://localhost:8000"
    
    func sendMessage(_ message: String) async throws -> String {
        guard let url = URL(string: "\(baseURL)/query") else {
            throw URLError(.badURL)
        }
        
        var request = URLRequest(url: url)
        request.httpMethod = "POST"
        request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        
        let body = ["query": message]
        request.httpBody = try JSONEncoder().encode(body)
        
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
        let response = try JSONDecoder().decode(QueryResponse.self, from: data)
        return response.response
    }
}

// Usage in SwiftUI
struct ChatView: View {
    @State private var messages: [Message] = []
    @State private var newMessage = ""
    private let chat = AgentChat()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Messages list
            ScrollView {
                ForEach(messages) { message in
                    MessageRow(message: message)
                }
            }
            
            // Input field
            HStack {
                TextField("Type a message...", text: $newMessage)
                Button("Send") {
                    Task {
                        await sendMessage()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    func sendMessage() async {
        do {
            let response = try await chat.sendMessage(newMessage)
            messages.append(Message(text: newMessage, isUser: true))
            messages.append(Message(text: response, isUser: false))
            newMessage = ""
        } catch {
            print("Error: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Features
- Messages are processed in context (the API maintains conversation history)
- Responses include the assistant's personality traits
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous implementations
- Error handling for network and API issues
- Rate limiting compliance built into examples

### Best Practices
1. Implement retry logic for failed requests
2. Handle rate limiting (429) responses gracefully
3. Show loading states during API calls
4. Maintain local message history for offline viewing
5. Implement proper error handling and user feedback

## Personality Settings

The assistant's personality can be customized:
```bash
# Adjust humor level (0.0 to 1.0)
set humor 0.7

# Set formality level (0.0 to 1.0)
set formality 0.3

# Toggle personality traits
toggle trait [witty/empathetic/curious/enthusiastic]

# Control emoji usage
toggle emoji [on/off]
```

## Security Notes

- API keys (OpenAI and Google) are stored locally in your .env file
- All document processing happens on your machine
- Memory storage is local and under your control
- Web access is configurable and can be restricted
- Voice synthesis is performed locally using kokoro-onnx
- Rate limiting is enabled by default to prevent API abuse

## Contributing

This is an evolving project, and contributions are welcome! Whether it's adding new agents, improving existing functionality, or enhancing documentation, please feel free to submit pull requests.

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Enhanced voice synthesis options
- [ ] Improved agent coordination
- [ ] Expanded local capabilities
- [ ] Advanced memory management
